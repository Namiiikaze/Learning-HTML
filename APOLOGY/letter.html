    <div class="handwriting">Hi Ife,</div>
    
    <div class="letter-content">
      <p>
        This letter comes from the deepest part of my heart 
        a place of truth, vulnerability, and unwavering affection.
        It’s a letter of apology, of sincerity, of growth, 
        and most of all, a longing to make things right with you.
        I don’t even know where to begin not because I don’t have anything to say, 
        but because I know how much hurt I caused by walking away when I should have stayed.
        I’ve said I was confused, and that’s true... but even more than that, 
      </p>
      <p>
        You once told me I reminded you of someone from your past,
         and though I don’t know what that story holds, I need you to know:
        I am not him.
        I am me. And what I feel for you is mine alone sincere, intentional, and real.
        
        You deserve far more than fleeting words on a screen.
        You deserve warmth, presence, and someone who chooses you again and again, with no hesitation.
        You deserve someone whose world revolves around yours 
        the way the earth leans towards the sun for light, warmth, and direction.
        You deserve the kind of love that sees you even in silence, 
        that senses when your heart shifts, no matter the distance.
        I wanted to be that person for you I still do but somewhere along the way, 
        I let my flaws speak louder than my intentions.
        I missed the little things, the tiny details that meant the world. 
        I failed to truly listen when it mattered most, and I carry that regret with me every day.

        Leaving you when you needed me... I’ll never forgive myself for that moment of weakness.
        You deserved someone to stay, to hold space for your heart and I disappeared.
        I am so, deeply sorry.

        But I’m not here just to apologize.
        I’m here to change, to show up, and to be there not just in grand gestures but in the quiet, 
        steady ways that matter most.

        I’m not going anywhere this time.
        If you’ll let me, I’ll spend every day earning back your trust, 
        your comfort, and the light you brought into my world.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I’m not running anymore. I’m here—with honesty, 
        with growth, with all the love I didn’t know how to hold back then. 
        You’re still the warmth I remember, the gentle laughter in my memory, 
        the what-if I never stopped thinking about.
      </p>
      <p>
        There’s still so much on my heart, and I know not everything needs an answer 
        I know you may not have all the answers either, and that’s okay.
         When it comes to love to relationships
        my story has been marked more by pain than peace. 
        I’ve been on the receiving end of hurt more times than I care to remember. 
        None of my past relationships made it beyond a few fleeting months,
        and I’ve never truly known what it feels like to be fully seen and completely loved in return.
        I know this isn’t your burden to carry, but I share this with you not for pity or explanation 
        but because, as I said before, this letter is about reform.
        It’s about clarity, honesty, and taking responsibility.
        The truth is...I haven’t changed into someone new 
        I’ve simply realized I need to be better.
        Better at noticing you,
        Better at understanding what matters,
        Better at showing up, even in the quiet moments when nothing is said but everything is felt.

        I don’t know if I ever gave you a reason not to trust me, but if I did I’m sorry.
        Please know this: I trust you completely.
        And even if nothing ever grows from this, 
        even if we never get back to what we once were 
        I’m still willing to take that leap and put my heart out there for you.
        Because you’re worth the risk. I’m not running anymore, Ife.
        I remember those calm, beautiful moments when we’d sit together in silence on a call, 
        and somehow those quiet moments meant everything. 
        I still think about them more than you probably know.
        Maybe it won’t be easy to get back to that place, to that comfort 
        but I want to believe we can.
        And even if it takes time, I’ll be patient. 
        I’ll keep showing up, because those moments with you are worth everything to me.
        I can’t go back and rewrite the past 
        but I can promise to shape the present and the future 
        into something more beautiful than we ever imagined.
